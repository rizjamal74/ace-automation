## Summary

The Aviatrix Certified Engineer Multicloud Network Automation Specialty (IaC) course brings the concepts of DevOps together by automating network infrastructure through hands-on labs. Students can expect to enter the training with no coding background and complete the training with an understanding of how to use IaC tools (GitHub and Terraform Cloud) to onboard, monitor, extend, and protect cloud networks at scale using code.

## Course Format and System Requirements

The ACE Automation Specialty course is in a virtual, self-paced format with lecture content and 4 hands-on labs.

Duration: Approximately 4 Hours

### Course Objectives

- Learn how to onboard, monitor, and protect existing cloud networks by deploying the Aviatrix Cloud Native Security Fabric (CNSF) using the Aviatrix Terraform provider.
- Build a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub actions and Terraform HCL to implement changes to the CNSF based on new security requirements.
- Understand how Security, Networking, and Application teams can all collaborate via code to implement those requirements and reduce friction between those teams.
- Build, extend and protect multicloud networks without prior deep coding or CSP experience by leveraging the Aviatrix Terraform provider and LLMs.

### Intended Audience

- DevOps Teams
- SecOps Teams
- NetSecOps Teams
- Operations Teams
- Infrastructure Teams

### Network Topology

This course will guide you through the deployment and configuration of the Aviatrix Cloud Native Security Fabric starting with an initial topology of existing networks and workloads:

#### Initial
